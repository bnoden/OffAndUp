This folder contains the files needed to run OffAndUp in the Microsoft Edge Browser.  

As I don't currently wish to pay $19 to *maybe* get this free extension into the  
Microsoft store, it must be manually installed for now.  

The steps for this are as follows:  

1. Either download and extract this folder (use WinRAR, WinZip, 7zip, etc.) or git clone it  
2. In Edge, click the `...` button (aka `Settings and more`, on the top-right by default)  
3. Click `Extensions`  
4. Click `Load Extension`  
5. Select the folder that you either extracted or cloned (named `oau_edge` by default)
6. It should now be loaded. Now go to the OffAndUp extension and click on the  
gear icon for settings.  
7. Click the toggle switch to `On`. And you're done!
