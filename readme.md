##### `IgnoreSoldItems`   
When browsing listings, sold items are mixed in with other results.
This can be frustrating when you see something you want, only to discover it's already
sold.  `IgnoreSoldItems` lowers the opacity of sold listings to 0.25, so you can still
see them, but aren't fooled by them. That's my preference, but of course it can easily
be adjusted.

##### `PreviewListing`  
At this point, `ShowListing` would be a more accurate title, because it
shows the whole item page. Still debating whether to make it more preview-like or
change the name. This shows the item page without leaving the query results page.
Do this by moving the mouse cursor over the item image for 1.25 seconds. Exit and
return to results page by clicking the results page, which during this time is covered
by a colored layer.

The original intention was to keep you on the results page so you wouldn't have to
re-run `IgnoreSoldItems` upon returning and reloading. Yes, you could open link in a
new tab, but this streamlines the process.  

A link is provided at the top, which when clicked, opens the page in a new tab.
